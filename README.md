# ApEx

An API Example project with basic asynchronous workers.  The basic scripts make
use of Heroku's tool belt, but there's no reason that it can't be deployed
differently.


## Setup
You should make (and use) a `virtualenv`.  If you don't have
`virtualenvwrapper` installed, I recommend doing that.

Once `virtualenvwrapper` is installed, you can simply:

```bash
mkvirtualenv apex
```


## Running a Local (Development) Server
You need 4 things to run locally:

1. A working virtualenv
2. The Heroku tool belt (this isn't strictly necessary, it's just convenient)
3. A running Celery-compatible broker of some kind, with the URL exported to
   `CELERY_BROKER_URL`
4. A running Celery-compatible task backend, with the URL exported to
   `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`

For example, the broker (RabbitMQ) & backend (Redis) could be spun up using
docker:

```bash
docker run -P -d --name apex-rabbit rabbitmq
docker run -P -d --name apex-redis redis redis-server
```

Then you simply:

```bash
./scripts/run-local
```


## Deploying to Heroku
To setup a Heroku deployment for experimental purposes, simply:

```bash
./scripts/initialize-heroku
```


## Using the Service
This service has one endpoint at `/sums`.  You can post a list of numbers
there, and it will create a background job to add them.  You can check on the
status of the job, and retrieve the result of the addition from the URL given
in the location header of the POST response.
